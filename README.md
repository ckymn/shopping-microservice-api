# SHOPPING MICROSERVICE BUILD WITH NODE.JS

```
Microservices with Node.js Example In this demo application, we will build microservices with NodeJS which will connect to an external API.
The app will have three services: Products, Customer, and Shopping services. Each of the services will have individual servers running on different ports. 
These services will communicate with each other through REST APIs. We all know that if it wasn’t microservices architecture we would have only one server running. 
But, in microservices architecture the scenario is different.
So, this was about what we are building in this tutorial, let’s get started with the coding part.
